# DESCRIPTION 
This is just a repo of my various configuration and rc files I use. These are mainly from my desktop where I use WSL so you may find some oddities like me calling pslist.exe with wps. Just comment it out and you'll be fine.

# INSTALLATION 
Most of these are .files so theyre pretty easy to handle just follow the steps below. 

```
mv desktop_bash_aliases .bash_aliases
#Checking to make sure it sources it if it exists
egrep ".bash_aliases" ~/.bashrc 

mv tmux.conf .tmux.conf 
...
...
...
You get the idea.
```
